# Light Data Transmitter and Receiver

This repository holds the old code and report (in French) for a transmitter
and receiver that me and my friend Do Nhat Minh (LFAY '20) made for our final
French Baccalaureate project (TPE, Travaux Personnels Encadr√©s).

The project made use of two ATMega328 microcontrollers, both flashed with the
Arduino bootloader. One powers the transmitter, which can send a text message by
blinking a white LED, and the other the receiver, which receives the text message
via a solar panel, decodes it and displays it on a liquid-crystal display.

Check out the `images` folder for some pictures of the devices, and come back soon
for more details on the project (and maybe an English translation of parts of the
report and of the comments in the code too)!
